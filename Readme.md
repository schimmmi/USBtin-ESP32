USBtin ESP32 - Simple USB to CAN interface
------------------------------------

This archive is a fork from the USBtin project. You'll find the original repository under https://github.com/doganov/usbtin.
USBtin is a simple USB to CAN interface. You find further information about
USBtin on the project homepage: http://www.fischl.de/usbtin.

The USBtin ESP32 CAN interface is compatible to the original USBtin but will take use of the build in CAN interface of the ESP32. Therefore it is possible to use it as CANsocket device under Linux or with the toolset of the original USBtin. 

Thanks to Thomas Fischl for this grate work!
